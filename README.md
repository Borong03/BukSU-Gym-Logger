### BukSU Fitness Gym - Digital Logging System

------------

### About the System:

> The BukSU Fitness Gym - Digital Logging System (DLS) is designed to provide an efficient gym access for bonafide students, instructors, and personnel at Bukidnon State University. The primary purpose is to implement a DLS that uses biometric authentication for secure and efficient entry, reducing the hassle of writing, and enhancing the data accuracy.

> The goal of this project is to improve efficiency, security, and user experience and to foster a more organized environment. Each gym visit will be logged automatically using the memberâ€™s fingerprint. The system will also limit gym access to three visits per week, resetting every Sunday to ensure fair use of gym facilities.

### Group Members:
